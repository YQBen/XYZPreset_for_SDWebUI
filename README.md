🚀 **XYZpreset** is a lightweight browser extension specifically designed for storing and switching xyzplot script presets. Please note that it's currently not a webui plugin, but a Chrome browser extension.

## Background

The operative premise for the current version is that the webui address is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. This approach might seem a tad unorthodox, but given its ease of implementation, it was chosen for this initial release. Future adjustments will be driven by evolving needs.

## Installation

1. Ensure the `XYZpreset` folder is ready.
2. Go to Chrome's “Extensions” page.
3. Activate “Developer mode” in the top-right corner.
4. Click “Load unpacked” in the top-left and select the `XYZpreset` folder.
5. Return to the webui. A page refresh might be necessary for the plugin to function as intended.

🛠 For functionalities and buttons within the extension, a little exploration should do the trick!

## Future Roadmap

- **WebUI Integration**: There's a genuine intention to eventually transform it into a comprehensive webui plugin for smoother integration. However, the timeline remains uncertain.
- **Internationalization**: An English version is under consideration, if there's a demand.

## Note

At present, this extension is tailored for Chrome. Expanding its compatibility is under deliberation.
